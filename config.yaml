# here you can control infinite mode to make it harder/easier for yourself
# interval is basically time before next letter spawns
# currently it's a function of time and looks like this:
# interval = infinite_mode_start_interval - (time * infinite_mode_interval_drop_speed) / math.log10(time)
# also
# interval = max(interval, infinite_mode_min_interval)
# it's not great but it works - I'm open to suggestions

# this one isn't really starting interval...
# but intervals should start around this value ^^

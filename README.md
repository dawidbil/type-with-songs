### type-with-songs

#### TODO

* scoreboard on top of the screen with information: hits/misses, time left
* add support for lowercase/uppercase and symbols that need shift modifier
* add music in background
* create map files which will determine when what letters appear
* add menu where you can select map
* add map editor, so it's possible to sync appearing letters with music
* some kind of graphic overhaul, so it doesn't look so ugly
